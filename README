JHU Turbulence Database Cluster
Matlab Interface Library
http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/

**** About this package ****

This library provides a very simple wrapper around Matlab
intrinsic SOAP functions for calling the JHU Turbulence 
Database Cluster.

More information can be found at:
  http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/help/

This package can be executed directly from Matlab. All
communication with the JHU Turbulence Database Cluster
is provided through the TurbulenceService Matlab class
which uses the Matlab intrinsic SOAP functions. As of 
now only the getVelocity function is provided; functionality
for additional functions will be added sometime in the
near future.

**** How to use ****

A sample program is provided in turbm2.m. Using the 
default settings it will probe 32 points in the x and y
directions at a random z location and return the velocity.
The u-velocity component will be returned and displayed 
in a contour plot. This sample file can be modified to
the end users needs.

**** Identification Token (required for large queries) ****

While our service is open to anyone, we would like to keep track
of who is using the service, and how.  To this end, we would
like each user or site to obtain an authorization token from us:
  http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/help/authtoken.html

If you are just experimenting, the default token included in
these test files should be valid.

**** Platform-specific notes ****

Has been tested on newer Windows, Mac, and Linux Matlab installations.

**** Error Handling ****

Not directly implemented yet.
