JHU Turbulence Database Cluster
Matlab Interface Library
http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/

**** About this package ****

This set of functions provide a wrapper around Matlab
intrinsic SOAP functions for calling the JHU Turbulence 
Database Cluster. All communication with the JHU Turbulence 
Database Cluster is provided through the TurbulenceService 
Matlab class which uses the Matlab intrinsic SOAP functions.

More information can be found at:

**** How to use ****

A sample program is provided in turbm.m. Using the 
default settings it will probe 32 points in the x and y
directions at a random z location and return the velocity.
The u-velocity component will be returned and displayed 
in a contour plot. This sample file can be modified to
the end users needs.

**** Identification Token (required for large queries) ****

While our service is open to anyone, we would like to keep track
of who is using the service, and how.  To this end, we would
like each user or site to obtain an authorization token from us:
  http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/help/authtoken.html

If you are just experimenting, the default token included in
these test files should be valid.

**** Platform-specific notes ****

Has been tested on newer Windows, Mac, and Linux Matlab installations.

**** Error Handling ****

Not directly implemented yet. 

**** Known Issues ****

1) When retrieving large amounts of data, the heap memory of
   Matlab's Java Virtual Machine may overflow. It is then
   requirted to increase the Java heap memory. For additional
