JHU Turbulence Database Cluster
Matlab Interface Library
http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/

**** About this package ****

This set of functions provide a wrapper around Matlab
intrinsic SOAP functions for calling the JHU Turbulence 
Database Cluster. All communication with the JHU Turbulence 
Database Cluster is provided through the TurbulenceService 
Matlab class which uses the Matlab intrinsic SOAP functions.

**** How to use ****

A sample Matlab program is provided by turbm.m. To use simply
run this program from Matlab. In this program each the usage 
of each Turbulence Database function is illustrated. The 
program will sample each quantity (i.e., velocity, velocity 
gradient, etc.) at 10 locations. The returned values will be
written to screen. The sample program also generates a contour 
surface of the velocity magnitude at a random z-plane location.

User specific programs may be created by 
The u-velocity component will be returned and displayed 
in a contour plot. This sample file can be modified to
the end users needs.

**** Identification Token (required for large queries) ****

While our service is open to anyone, we would like to keep track
of who is using the service, and how.  To this end, we would
like each user or site to obtain an authorization token from us:
  http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/help/authtoken.html

If you are just experimenting, the default token included in
these test files should be valid.

**** Platform-specific notes ****

Has been tested on newer installations of Matlab on various
flavors of Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows.

**** Error Handling ****

Not directly implemented yet. 

**** Known Issues ****

1) When retrieving large amounts of data, the heap memory of
   Matlab's Java Virtual Machine may overflow. It is then
   required to increase the Java heap memory. For additional
